# Data_Mining_CQ2022-21

This is where i upload all my works, resources and related documents for the subject of Data Mining. The subject requires basic knowledge of Data Processing, Analysis and so on. The curriculum includes: 3 Labs, some In-class tests, 1 Midterm Test and 1 EndTerm Test which you can find [here](Paper%20Test/)

Regarding the Labs, you can take mine as references. Since there're some trouble uploading big files to Github, the data for each Lab had been uploaded to [GG Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-CExDWL36rmC8FO6Bw4aGuGBTyASk2D0?usp=sharing) instead.
